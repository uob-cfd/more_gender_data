This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by
placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.


```{r}
# A little calculation, to warm up.
42 * 2
```

As you probably know by now, you can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert
Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be
saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to
preview the HTML file).

In this Notebook, we will ask you to "show" some values.  For example, imagine
you had already set a variable `a` to contain the value 10:

```{r}
a <- 10
```

To "show"" the value, you put the variable on a line on its own, at the end of
the chunk, like this:

```{r}
a
```

When you execute the chunk, the value appears after the chunk.

## Introducing the data

The Notebook uses the same data that you have already seen in the [R
from scratch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-from-scratch)
tutorial.

As you may remember from the tutorial, this dataset is a subset of a
larger dataset from the World Bank on gender and inequality:
<https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics>.

The subset is a selection of variables for every country. For each variable,
we have taken the mean of all available values from 2012 through 2016.  If
you're very interested, the data processing is in [this web
directory](https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/master/gender_stats).

As in the tutorial, we need to load the file into memory, as an R
*data frame*:

```{r}
# Run this chunk.  Do not change it.
gender_data <- read.csv('gender_stats.csv')
```

After executing the chunk above, you should have a new variable called
`gender_data`, of type *data frame*.

One way of getting a quick look at the data, is to use the `head` function on
the new `gender_data` data frame, like this:

```{r}
# Run this chunk.
head(gender_data)
```

This shows the first six rows of the data frame, along with the column names.
You already know these column names from the tutorial.  You can see all the
column names with:

```{r}
# Run this chunk.
names(gender_data)
```

Here are the column names with a brief description of what they mean:

* `fert_rate`: Fertility rate, total (births per woman).
* `gdp_us_billion`: GDP in units of current US billion dollars.
* `health_exp_per_cap`: Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011
  international \$).
* `health_exp_pub`: Health expenditure, public (% of GDP).
* `prim_ed_girls`: Primary education, pupils (% female).
* `mat_mort_ratio`: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births).
* `population`: Population, total (millions).

## Exploring the data

Our hypothesis is that there may be some relationship between the
amount of public money that a country spends on health
(`health_exp_pub`), and the maternal mortality ratio
(`mat_mort_ratio`).

Because you are now have some training in data analysis, you want to
explore the data first.

A first step is to look at the distributions of the values for each
column, using histograms.

First show the histogram for the `health_exp_pub` column:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show a histogram of the 'health_exp_pub' column of
#- the 'gender_data' data frame.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 10 so far).
hist(...)
```

Next show the histogram for the `mat_mort_ratio` column:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show a histogram of the 'mat_mort_ratio' column of
#- the 'gender_data' data frame.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 15 so far).
...
```

Use the `median` function to calculate the default median value for
`health_exp_pub` is `NA` (Not Available):

```{r}
#- Use the 'median' function to calculate that the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub` column of 'gender_data' is NA. Store as `med_hep_all`.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 20 so far).
med_hep_all <- ...
# Don't change the code below.
# Show the result
med_hep_all
```

This NA value means that one or more of the `health_exp_pub` values are NA.

Remember your "R from scratch" reading, and repeat the median calculation, but
dropping the NA values:

```{r}
#- Type the command to calculate the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub` column, after removing the NA values.
#- Store as variable `med_hep_present`.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 30 so far).
med_hep_present <- ...
# Don't change the code below.
# Show the result
med_hep_present
```

Calculate the median value for the `mat_mort_ratio` column, after dropping the
NA values:

```{r}
#- Type the command to calculate the median value for the
#- `mat_mort_ratio` column, after removing the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 35 so far).
med_mmr <- ...
# Don't change the code below.
# Show the result
med_mmr
```

## Plotting the variables

Plot the `health_exp_pub` column against the `mat_mort_ratio` column.
The data from the `health_exp_pub` column should be on the x axis, and
the data from the `mat_mort_ratio` column should be on the y axis.

```{r}
#- Type the commands to plot values in the 'health_exp_pub' column
#- against the `mat_mort_ratio` values.
#- 15 marks / 140 (total 50 so far).
...
```

## Calculating public health expenditure per person

Have a look at the definition of `health_exp_pub` above - it is public health
expenditure as a percentage of the country's [Gross Domestic
Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) (GDP).

Maybe that is not a good measure to use, to predict maternal mortality.  Maybe
the key measure is not the percentage of the GDP spent on health, but the
public dollars spent per person (per capita).

You need to calculate this number, for each row (and therefore, each country).

Start by dividing `health_exp_pub` by 100, to get public health expenditure as
a *proportion* of GDP.  The chunk below makes a new variable, where every
element in the `health_exp_pub` column has been divided by 100. Run it to get
the new variable:

```{r}
# Calculate public health expenditure as proportion of GDP
# Don't change the code here.
# Run this chunk to create the variable.
health_exp_pub_prop <- gender_data$health_exp_pub / 100
# Show the first six values
head(health_exp_pub_prop)
```

You can check this calculation by showing the median of the
`health_exp_pub_prop` variable, after removing the `NA` values.  It should be
same as the value you found for `med_hep_present` above, but divided by 100.

**Remember `health_exp_pub_prop` is a *variable* and not a column in a data
frame**.

```{r}
#- Type the command to calculate the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub_prop` variable, after removing the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 55 so far).
med_hep_prop <- ...
# Don't change the code below.
# Show the result
med_hep_prop
```

Next, make a new variable called `health_exp_pub_total`, by multiplying the
values in your `health_exp_pub_prop` variable by the values in the
`gdp_us_billion` column of `gender_data`.  This gives you the total public
health expenditure, in billions of US dollars.

```{r}
#- Create a new variable 'health_exp_pub_total' that contains the
#- `health_exp_pub_prop` variable multiplied by the 'gdp_us_billion'
#- column of 'gender_data'.
#- Your code will start with 'health_exp_pub_total <-'
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 65 so far).
health_exp_pub_total <- ...
# Show the first 6 values in the result
head(health_exp_pub_total)
```

Finally, make another new variable, `health_exp_pub_per_cap`, that contains the
result of dividing the values in `health_exp_pub_total` by the values in the
`population` column of `gender_data`.

The `population` column is in units of a million people, so the result is in
units of billion dollars per million people, or, equivalently, in thousands of
dollars per person.

Therefore, this is the public health expenditure per person (per _capita_), in
thousands of dollars.

```{r}
#- Create a new variable 'health_exp_pub_per_cap' that contains the
#- `health_exp_pub_total` variable divided by the 'population' column of
#- 'gender_data'.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 75 so far).
health_exp_pub_per_cap <- ...
# Show the first six values in the result.
head(health_exp_pub_per_cap)
```

Show a histogram of the values in `health_exp_pub_per_cap`:

```{r}
#- Show a histogram of the values in 'health_exp_pub_per_cap`.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 85 so far).
...
```

Calculate the median of the values in `health_exp_pub_per_cap`, with the `NA`
values removed:

```{r}
#- Show the median of the values in 'health_exp_pub_per_cap`, after removing
#- the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 90 so far).
med_heppc <- ...
# Show the result.
med_heppc
```

Plot the `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values against the values in the
`mat_mort_ratio` column of `gender_data`.  The `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values
go on the x axis, and the `mat_mort_ratio` values go on the y axis.

```{r}
#- Plot 'health_exp_pub_per_cap' against `mat_mort_ratio`.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 100 so far).
...
```

## Follow the money

It looks as if per-capita spending on health care makes a big difference
between values of 0 and 1 (thousand dollars), but much less difference, per
thousand dollars, for higher values.

Let's restrict our attention to the countries that are spending more than 1
thousand public dollars on health care, per person.

First, we make a copy of the `gender_data` data frame, called `with_heppc`.
Then we put the `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values into the copied data frame as
a new column.

```{r}
# Run this code; do not change it.
# Copy the `gender_data` data frame.
with_heppc <- data.frame(gender_data)
# Put the health_exp_pub_per_cap values into the copy as a new column.
with_heppc$heppc <- health_exp_pub_per_cap
# Show the first six rows of this new data frame.
head(with_heppc)
```

If you scroll across the columns of the `with_heppc` data frame, you will see
that that the `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values are in a new column called
`heppc`.

Use the `subset` function to select the rows from the new `with_heppc` data
frame that have values in the `heppc` column that are greater than 1. If you
can't remember how to take subsets, go back over the [DataCamp tutorial]
(https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis).

Call the result of your subset: `rich_gd`.

```{r}
#- Select rows from the `with_heppc` data frame, corresponding to values > 1 in
#- the `heppc` - column.
#- 15 marks / 140 (total 115 so far).
rich_gd <- ...
# Don't change this code.
# Show the first six rows of the result.
head(rich_gd)
```

You might want to look at the results above to check that the values in the
new subset do indeed all have values for `heppc` that are greater than 1.

Now we just have the countries that are spending more than a thousand public
dollars per person on health care, is there any convincing relationship
between how much the country spends, and the maternal mortality ratio?

Use the new `rich_gd` data frame to plot the `heppc` values on the x axis
against the `mat_mort_ratio` values on the y-axis, for the high-spending
countries.

```{r}
#- Plot the `heppc` values (x-axis) against the `mat_mort_ratio` values
#- (y-axis) *for the `rich_gd` data frame.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 125 so far).
...
```

I hope you find that there does not seem to be a strong relationship of the
spending of these high-spending countries, and the maternal mortality ratio.

Some of these countries seem to be spending a lot, and yet still have a fairly
high maternal mortality ratio.  The money does not seem to be effective in
improving health for childbirth, overall.

Use `subset` to find and show the countries in the `rich_gd` data frame that
have a value greater than 12 in `mat_mort_ratio`:

```{r}
#- Select the rows from `rich_gd` where `mat_mort_ratio` is greater than 12.
#- 10 marks / 140 (total 135 so far).
bad_rich <- ...
# Show the result.
bad_rich
```

Have a look at the result.  Now fill in value for the `worst_value_country`
variable below with the full name of the country from the `rich_gd` data frame
that has the highest `mat_mort_ratio`.  For example, if you thought that New
Zealand had the highest `mat_mort_ratio` in the `rich_gd` data frame, your
answer would be:

```
worst_value_country <- "New Zealand".
```

```{r}
#- Here I've set the country name to "United Kingdom", which is wrong. 
#- Change it to the full name of the country with the highest
#- `mat_mort_ratio`.
#- 5 marks / 140 (total 140 so far).
worst_value_country <- "United Kingdom"
# Show the result.
worst_value_country
```
